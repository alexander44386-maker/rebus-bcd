# 🎮 Rebus Rumble — Self-Hosted Multiplayer

A real-time multiplayer picture-puzzle game running on your own server so
connections are reliable. No more "Could not reach that room" errors from the
overloaded public PeerJS cloud.

---

## How it works

```
Browser A (host)  ──┐
                    ├── PeerJS signaling (your server) ──► WebRTC peer-to-peer data channel
Browser B (guest) ──┘
```

Your server only handles the **handshake** (signaling). Once connected, all
game data flows directly between browsers via WebRTC. The server is very
lightweight — it handles almost no ongoing traffic.

---

## Run locally (fastest way to test)

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Open **http://localhost:3000** in two different browsers (or two tabs — but
for a real test, use two different devices on the same network).

## Deploy to Render (free, recommended)

1. Push this folder to a GitHub repo.
2. Go to https://render.com → **New → Web Service**.
3. Connect your repo, set:
   - **Build command:** `npm install`
   - **Start command:** `node server.js`
   - **Environment variable:** `PUBLIC_URL` = `https://your-app.onrender.com`
4. Click **Create Web Service**.

Render gives you a free HTTPS URL. Share it — anyone on the internet can play.

## Deploy to Railway

1. Push to GitHub.
2. Go to https://railway.app → **New Project → Deploy from GitHub repo**.
3. Add environment variable: `PUBLIC_URL` = `https://your-app.up.railway.app`
4. Railway auto-detects Node.js and deploys.

## Deploy to a VPS / DigitalOcean / Hetzner

```bash
# On the server
git clone <your-repo>
cd rebus-rumble
npm install

# With PM2 (keeps it running after logout)
npm install -g pm2
PORT=3000 PUBLIC_URL=https://yourdomain.com pm2 start server.js --name rebus

# Point nginx to port 3000 and add SSL via certbot
```

Minimal nginx config:
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
    }
}
```

## Environment variables

| Variable     | Default                  | Description                        |
|--------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `PORT`       | `3000`                   | Port the server listens on         |
| `PUBLIC_URL` | *(auto-detected)*        | Full public URL (set on any host)  |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| "Could not reach that room" | Make sure the host's tab is still open; check PUBLIC_URL is set correctly |
| Connection works locally but not remotely | Set `PUBLIC_URL` to your real domain with `https://` |
| Players behind corporate firewall | Add a TURN server to the `iceServers` array in `server.js` |
